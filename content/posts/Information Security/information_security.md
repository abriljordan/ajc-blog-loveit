# Elements of Information Security

# Information security consists of five major elements:

1. Confidentiality. Indicates that the data is secure and cannot be accessed by anybody who is not authorized.
2. Integrity. Describes the fact that the information/data has not been changed by an unauthorized user.
3. Availability. Availability practices ensure that a given stakeholder has timely and unobtrusive access to the necessary data.
4. Authenticity. Authenticity is the attribute that guarantees that a message, a document, or any other data is authentic or unaltered. The primary function of authentication is to verify the legitimacy of a user. Data, transactions, conversations, and documents are authenticated by controls like biometrics, smart cards, and digital certificates.
5. Non-repudiation. Non-repudiation is a means to ensure that both the sender and the recipient of a message cannot later deny having sent or received the message. Digital signatures are used by both individuals and businesses to guarantee non-repudiation.
