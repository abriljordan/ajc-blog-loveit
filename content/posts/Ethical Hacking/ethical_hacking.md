Cyber Kill Chain Methodology
1. Reconnaissance. The attacker conducts reconnaissance to collect information about the target looking for vulnerability that can help in gaining backdoor access.
2. Weaponization. The attacker creates an attack vector, such as remote access trojan, ransomware, virus or worm, that can exploit a known vulnerability. 
3. Delivery. The adversary launches the attack.  
4. Exploitation. The malicious code is executed within the victim’s system.
5. Installation. The malware or other attack vector will be installed on the victim’s system.
6. Command and Control. The malware can be used by the attacker to assume remote control of a computer or other object inside the target network. The attacker may also attempt to migrate laterally around the network at this time, increasing their access and creating new points of entry for the future.
7. Actions on Objectives. The attacker takes action to accomplish their stated objectives, which could involve exfiltration, data exfiltration, data exfiltration, or data destruction.
